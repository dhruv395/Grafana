When you enable HTTP authentication, InfluxDB requires you to create at least one admin user before you can interact with the system.
CREATE USER <username> WITH PASSWORD '<password>' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES

GRANT administrative privileges to an existing user
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES TO <username>

REVOKE administrative privileges from an admin user
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES FROM <username>

SHOW all existing users and their admin status
SHOW USERS

CREATE a new non-admin user
CREATE USER <username> WITH PASSWORD '<password>'

GRANT READ, WRITE or ALL database privileges to an existing user
GRANT [READ,WRITE,ALL] ON <database_name> TO <username>

GRANT ALL access to todd on the NOAA_water_database database:
GRANT ALL ON "NOAA_water_database" TO "todd"

REVOKE ALL privileges from todd on the NOAA_water_database database:
 REVOKE WRITE ON "NOAA_water_database" FROM "todd"
 
 SHOW a user’s database privileges
 SHOW GRANTS FOR <user_name>
 
 ReSET a user’s password
 SET PASSWORD FOR <username> = '<password>'
 
 DROP a user
 DROP USER <username>
 
  login to influxdb
influx -username '<username>' -password '<password>'

SHOW STATS                                                          : To see node statistics

SHOW RETENTION POLICIES
CREATE DATABASE "NOAA_water_database"

Create a database with a specific retention policy
CREATE DATABASE <database_name> [WITH [DURATION <duration>] [REPLICATION <n>] [SHARD DURATION <duration>] [NAME <retention-policy-name>]]
CREATE DATABASE "NOAA_water_database" WITH DURATION 3d REPLICATION 1 SHARD DURATION 1h NAME "liquid"
CREATE RETENTION POLICY "one_day_only" ON "NOAA_water_database" DURATION 1d REPLICATION 1
CREATE RETENTION POLICY "what_is_time" ON "NOAA_water_database" DURATION 2d REPLICATION 1
Create a DEFAULT retention policy
CREATE RETENTION POLICY "one_day_only" ON "NOAA_water_database" DURATION 23h60m REPLICATION 1 DEFAULT

Modify retention policies with ALTER RETENTION POLICY
ALTER RETENTION POLICY <retention_policy_name> ON <database_name> DURATION <duration> REPLICATION <n> SHARD DURATION <duration> DEFAULT
ALTER RETENTION POLICY "what_is_time" ON "NOAA_water_database" DURATION 3w SHARD DURATION 2h DEFAULT

Delete retention policies with DROP RETENTION POLICY
DROP RETENTION POLICY <retention_policy_name> ON <database_name>
DROP RETENTION POLICY "what_is_time" ON "NOAA_water_database"
 
DROP DATABASE <database_name>
 DROP SERIES FROM "h2o_feet"                                         :Drop all series from a single measurement:
 DROP SERIES FROM <measurement_name[,measurement_name]> WHERE <tag_key>='<tag_value>'
 DROP SERIES FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica'       : Drop series with a specific tag pair from a single measurement:
      Drop all points in the series that have a specific tag pair from all measurements in the database:
DROP SERIES WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica'  

  Delete series with DELETE
DELETE FROM <measurement_name> WHERE [<tag_key>='<tag_value>'] | [<time interval>]
  Delete all data associated with the measurement h2o_feet:
DELETE FROM "h2o_feet"
  Delete all data associated with the measurement h2o_quality and where the tag randtag equals 3:
DELETE FROM "h2o_quality" WHERE "randtag" = '3'
  Delete all data in the database that occur before January 01, 2016:
DELETE WHERE time < '2016-01-01'

The DROP MEASUREMENT query deletes all data and series from the specified measurement and deletes the measurement from the index.
DROP MEASUREMENT <measurement_name>
