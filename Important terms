What is the relationship between shard group durations and retention policies?
InfluxDB stores data in shard groups. A single shard group covers a specific time interval; InfluxDB determines that time interval 
by looking at the DURATION of the relevant retention policy (RP). The table below outlines the default relationship between 
the DURATION of an RP and the time interval of a shard group:

RP duration	Shard group interval
< 2 days	1 hour
>= 2 days and <= 6 months	1 day
> 6 months	7 days

Currently, non-admin users cannot execute a USE <database> query within the CLI even if they have read and write permissions on 
that database:
Explicitly connect to the relevant database when launching the CLI:
    influx -username 'username' -password 'password' -database 'special_db'
Specify the database in every query
    SELECT value FROM special_db.autogen.measurement
# OR
    SELECT value FROM special_db..measurement
